# Workshop - From setting up stack to an API client library in one evening

This is an introductory workshop to get acquainted with parts of
the Haskell tool-chain.
There are some [slides to start things up](https://github.com/diogob/haskell_wreq_workshop/blob/master/docs/haskell.pdf) in the repo.

Although this repo serves as an example the idea for this workshop is to guide
participants through the project bootstrap using the stack tool.
